# Intelligent Feedback Loop Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of an intelligent feedback loop in the Romani Translation AI application. The feedback loop allows the system to learn from expert corrections and improve its translation accuracy over time.

## Components

### 1. LearningInsight Model

A new `LearningInsight` model has been added to the database schema to store insights generated from translation corrections:

```prisma
model LearningInsight {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  // The core insight generated by the Analyzer AI
  rule        String   @db.Text
  category    String
  confidence  Float
  explanation String?  @db.Text
  embedding   Unsupported("vector(1536)")?

  // --- Contextual Metadata ---
  domain      String?   // e.g., "mythology", "medical", "casual"
  tags        String[] // e.g., ["formal", "dialogue"]

  // Link back to the source of this insight
  sourceTranslationMemoryId String?
  sourceTranslationMemory   TranslationMemory? @relation(fields: [sourceTranslationMemoryId], references: [id])
}
```

### 2. AI Analyzer Service

The AI analyzer service (`lib/ai-analyzer.ts`) generates learning insights from translation corrections. It analyzes the source text, AI translation, and expert correction to extract generalizable rules.

### 3. Correction API Endpoint

The correction API endpoint (`app/api/correct/route.ts`) has been modified to trigger the learning loop when a correction is made. It generates a learning insight using the AI analyzer and saves it to the database with an embedding.

### 4. Retrieval System

The retrieval system (`lib/retrieval.ts`) has been updated to include learning insights in the multi-source retrieval. The `searchLearningInsights` function queries the database for relevant learning insights using vector similarity.

### 5. Translation API Endpoint

The translation API endpoint (`app/api/translate/route.ts`) uses the unified retrieval service to fetch learning insights and includes them in the structured prompt for the AI translation service.

## Workflow

1. User submits a correction through the translation interface
2. Correction API endpoint saves the correction to the database
3. Correction API endpoint triggers the learning loop asynchronously
4. AI analyzer generates a learning insight from the correction
5. Learning insight is saved to the database with an embedding
6. Translation API endpoint retrieves learning insights during translation
7. Learning insights are included in the structured prompt for AI translation
8. AI uses the learning insights to improve translation accuracy

## Testing

Several test files have been created to verify the implementation:

- `test-ai-analyzer.ts`: Tests the AI analyzer service
- `test-correction-api.ts`: Tests the correction API endpoint and learning loop
- `test-learning-insights.ts`: Tests the retrieval of learning insights
- `test-unified-retrieval.ts`: Tests the unified retrieval service
- `test-translation-api.ts`: Tests the translation API endpoint with learning insights

## Future Improvements

- Implement more sophisticated AI analyzer prompts
- Add more metadata to learning insights (e.g., dialect, domain)
- Implement a feedback mechanism to refine learning insights over time
- Add visualization tools for learning insights in the admin interface
