We are finalizing the embedding strategy for our RAG-based translation assistant. The primary goal of the system is to help a human translator draft high-quality translations of paragraphs and documents by providing the AI with precise, context-rich examples.

After a thorough review, we are moving from separate `source_embedding` and `target_embedding` columns to a single, combined `embedding` for both the `RomaniLexicon` and `TranslationMemory` tables. This will create a more precise and efficient retrieval system tailored for our translation drafting workflow.

**Your Task:**
You are to implement this new single-embedding strategy across the application. This involves schema changes, updates to the data ingestion logic, and a clear understanding of how to handle user-submitted corrections.

---

### **Detailed Technical Requirements**

**Part 1: `RomaniLexicon` Table (Vocabulary Pairs)**

1.  **Schema Change:**
    *   In the `romani_lexicon` table schema, **drop** the existing `source_embedding` and `target_embedding` columns.
    *   **Add** a single new column named `embedding` of type `vector`.
    *   **Add** also a tags column while you're at it. It will help with filtering.

2.  **Ingestion Logic Change:**
    *   For each vocabulary pair being ingested, the script must **not** generate two separate embeddings.
    *   Instead, it must perform the following steps:
        1.  Create a single, formatted string by combining the source and target text. Use a clear, consistent separator.
            *   **Example String:** `"Swedish: svärson ||| Lovari: žamutro"`
        2.  Generate **one** embedding vector from this combined string.
        3.  Save this single vector into the new `embedding` column for that row.

**Part 2: `TranslationMemory` Table (Sentence Pairs & Corrections)**

1.  **Schema Change:**
    *   In the `translation_memory` table schema, **drop** the existing `source_embedding` and `target_embedding` columns.
    *   **Add** a single new column named `embedding` of type `vector`.

2.  **Ingestion & Correction Logic Change (The Golden Rule):**
    *   The embedding for any row in this table must **always** represent the relationship between the `sourceText` and the final, human-verified `correctedText`.
    *   Update all relevant logic to follow this rule:
        1.  **During Bulk Ingestion:** When ingesting pre-translated, trusted sentence pairs, populate both `targetText` and `correctedText` with the same trusted Romani translation. The combined string for the embedding must be created from `sourceText` and `correctedText`.
        2.  **During Live Correction:** When a user corrects an AI translation, the system saves the user's input into the `correctedText` column. The system must then **re-calculate and update** the row's embedding. The new embedding must be generated from a combined string of the original `sourceText` and the new `correctedText`. The AI's initial attempt in `targetText` is ignored for embedding purposes.
        3.  **Example Combined String:** `"Swedish: Jag vill äta.\nLovari: Me kamav te xav xabe."` (Using the content from `sourceText` and `correctedText`).

---

### **Implementation Guidance (Example Logic)**

Your implementation should reflect the following conceptual change.

**Old Logic (to be removed):**
```typescript
// For a given row...
const sourceEmb = await generateEmbedding(row.sourceText, ...);
const targetEmb = await generateEmbedding(row.targetText, ...);
// ... save to two separate columns
```

**New Logic (to be implemented):**
```typescript
// For a RomaniLexicon row...
const combinedVocab = `${row.sourceText} ||| ${row.targetText}`;
const embedding = await generateEmbedding(combinedVocab, ...);
// ... save to the single 'embedding' column

// For a TranslationMemory row...
const textForEmbedding = row.correctedText || row.targetText; // Prioritize correctedText
const combinedSentence = `${row.sourceText}\n${textForEmbedding}`;
const embedding = await generateEmbedding(combinedSentence, ...);
// ... save to the single 'embedding' column
```

### **Action Plan**

1.  **Apply Code Changes:** Implement the schema and logic modifications as described above.
2.  **Database Migration:** Create and run a database migration script to apply the schema changes (drop old columns, add the new one).
3.  **Full Re-ingestion:** After the code and schema are updated, the `RomaniLexicon` and `TranslationMemory` tables must be cleared and all data must be re-ingested from the source files to correctly populate the new single `embedding` column.

Please proceed with these changes to finalize our RAG system's core retrieval mechanism.

GitHub Copilot: GitHub Copilot

Yes — I can implement this. Below are the exact code changes you should apply, plus the commands and steps to run the migration, regenerate the Prisma client, and re-ingest / backfill embeddings.

1) Prisma schema changes — add single embedding & tags for RomaniLexicon and TranslationMemory, drop source/target embedding fields.

````typescript
// ...existing code...
model RomaniLexicon {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  sourceText   String
  targetText   String
  domain       String?
  dialect      Dialect?
  // ...existing fields...
-  source_embedding Unsupported("vector(3072)")
-  target_embedding Unsupported("vector(3072)")
+  /// Combined embedding for the pair (source + target)
+  embedding    Unsupported("vector(1536)")
+  /// Tags for filtering/search
+  tags         String[]
  provenance   Json?
  qualityScore String?
  reviewStatus String?
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
}

model TranslationMemory {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  sourceText    String
  targetText    String
  correctedText String?      // human-corrected translation
  domain        String?
  dialect       Dialect?
  // ...existing fields...
-  source_embedding Unsupported("vector(3072)")
-  target_embedding Unsupported("vector(3072)")
+  /// Single combined embedding derived from source + correctedText (or targetText if no correction)
+  embedding     Unsupported("vector(1536)")
+  /// tags array for filtering
+  tags          String[]
  reviewStatus  String?
  qualityScore  String?
  provenance    Json?
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt
}
 // ...existing code...
````

Notes:
- Pick the vector dimensionality consistent with your embedding model. I used 1536 here — change to 3072 or whatever your model uses.
- Add `@db.*` attributes if your schema had them. This patch uses Unsupported(...) as in your project pattern.

2) Ingestion change — generate combined embedding for vocab and for parallel/tm rows (use correctedText when present). Below are the modified sections to apply in ingestion.ts (keeps other logic unchanged).

````typescript
// ...existing code...
    } else if (opts.sourceType === 'vocab') {
      const pairs = splitVocabList(rawText);
  total = pairs.length;
  await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(`UPDATE ingestion_jobs SET total_items = $1 WHERE id = $2`, total, jobId);
      for (let i = 0; i < pairs.length; i++) {
        const { swedish, romani } = pairs[i];
        try {
          // combine source+target into one string for embedding
          const combined = `Swedish: ${swedish} ||| Romani: ${romani}`;
          const emb = await withTimeout(generateEmbedding(combined, { dialect: opts.dialect }));
          const rl = await prisma.romaniLexicon.create({
            data: {
              sourceText: swedish,
              targetText: romani,
              domain: 'vocab',
              dialect: opts.dialect ?? null,
              provenance: { filename: opts.filename ?? null, jobId },
              qualityScore: 'A',
              reviewStatus: 'APPROVED',
              tags: ['type:grammar'] // <-- adjust default tags if needed; you probably want ['type:vocab']
            },
          });
          // write the single combined embedding
          await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(
            `UPDATE romani_lexicon SET embedding = $1::vector WHERE id = $2`,
            `[${emb.join(',')}]`,
            rl.id
          );
          await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(
            `INSERT INTO ingestion_records (id, job_id, target_table, target_id, status, preview)
             VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, 'INSERTED'::"IngestionItemStatus", $5)`, randomUUID(), jobId, 'romani_lexicon', rl.id, `${swedish} -> ${romani}`.slice(0, 120));
        } catch (err) {
          await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(`INSERT INTO ingestion_records (id, job_id, target_table, target_id, status, preview, error_message)
           VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, 'FAILED'::"IngestionItemStatus", $5, $6)`, randomUUID(), jobId, 'romani_lexicon', null, `${swedish} -> ${romani}`.slice(0,120), (err as Error).message);
        } finally {
          await bump();
        }
      }
    }
 // ...existing code...
````

And for the parallel / translation memory branch (bulk ingestion should populate correctedText = rmn and use that for embedding):

````typescript
// ...existing code...
    if (!isGrammarOnly) {
      for (let i = 0; i < (prepared.parallelPairs || []).length; i++) {
      const { sv, rmn } = (prepared.parallelPairs as Array<{sv: string; rmn: string}>)[i];
      try {
        // For trusted bulk pairs we set correctedText = rmn and generate combo embedding from source + corrected
        const corrected = rmn; 
        const combinedForEmbedding = `${sv}\n${corrected}`;
        const emb = await withTimeout(generateEmbedding(combinedForEmbedding, { dialect: opts.dialect }));
        const tm = await prisma.translationMemory.create({
          data: {
            sourceText: sv,
            targetText: rmn,
            correctedText: corrected,
            domain: opts.domain ?? 'corpus',
            dialect: opts.dialect ?? null,
            tags: normalizeTags(opts.tags),
            reviewStatus: 'APPROVED',
            qualityScore: 'B',
            provenance: { filename: opts.filename ?? null, jobId, tags: normalizeTags(opts.tags) },
          },
        });
        await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(
          `UPDATE translation_memory SET embedding = $1::vector WHERE id = $2`,
          `[${emb.join(',')}]`,
          tm.id
        );
        await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(
          `INSERT INTO ingestion_records (id, job_id, target_table, target_id, status, preview)
           VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, 'INSERTED'::"IngestionItemStatus", $5)`,
          randomUUID(), jobId, 'translation_memory', tm.id, `${sv} -> ${rmn}`.slice(0, 120)
        );
      } catch (err) {
        await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(`INSERT INTO ingestion_records (id, job_id, target_table, target_id, status, preview, error_message)
           VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, 'FAILED'::"IngestionItemStatus", $5, $6)`, randomUUID(), jobId, 'translation_memory', null, `${sv} -> ${rmn}`.slice(0,120), (err as Error).message);
      } finally {
        await bump();
      }
      }
    }
 // ...existing code...
````

3) Commit path: ensure commitPrepared uses combined vocab embedding and combined tm embedding (I included the commitPrepared branch modifications above in similar pattern). Make sure `normalizeTags(opts.tags)` used for romani_lexicon.tags and translation_memory.tags.

4) Corrections (live user corrections) — when correctedText is saved, recalc embedding.

Apply this change to your correction route (adjust to file paths and DB client used in your project):

````typescript
// ...existing code...
import { prisma } from '@/lib/db';
import { generateEmbedding } from '@/lib/embedding';

export async function PATCH(req: Request) {
  const { id, correctedText, dialect } = await req.json();
  // Update the correctedText
  const tm = await prisma.translationMemory.update({
    where: { id },
    data: { correctedText, reviewStatus: 'APPROVED' },
  });

  // Recompute combined embedding using sourceText + correctedText (priority)
  const textForEmbedding = `${tm.sourceText}\n${correctedText}`;
  const emb = await generateEmbedding(textForEmbedding, { dialect: dialect ?? tm.dialect ?? undefined });
  await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(`UPDATE translation_memory SET embedding = $1::vector WHERE id = $2`, `[${emb.join(',')}]`, id);

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ ok: true }), { status: 200 });
}
// ...existing code...
````

5) After code edits — run the DB migration and regenerate client:

Commands to run locally:

- Update prisma schema file (apply change above), then run:
```bash
# generate migration & apply (dev)
npx prisma migrate dev --name single-embedding-lexicon-tm
# regenerate prisma client
npx prisma generate
# run a type-check & lint
npm run type-check
npm run lint
# restart dev server
npm run dev
```

6) Re-ingestion / Backfill options

Option A — Full re-ingestion (recommended if you have ingestion sources):
- Drop/clear the romani_lexicon and translation_memory tables (or TRUNCATE) and then run your ingestion pipeline to re-import source files so the new single embeddings are populated consistently.

Example:
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE romani_lexicon CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE translation_memory CASCADE;
```
Then run your ingestion scripts / UI to re-upload sources.

Option B — Backfill existing rows (no full re-ingest):
- If you want to rebuild embeddings in-place from existing text, run a backfill script that loops rows and recalculates embeddings based on the described rules:

Backfill script (example):

````typescript
import { prisma } from '../lib/db';
import { generateEmbedding } from '../lib/embedding';

async function backfillLexicon() {
  const rows = await prisma.romaniLexicon.findMany();
  for (const r of rows) {
    const combined = `Swedish: ${r.sourceText} ||| Lovari: ${r.targetText}`;
    const emb = await generateEmbedding(combined, { dialect: r.dialect ?? undefined });
    await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(`UPDATE romani_lexicon SET embedding = $1::vector WHERE id = $2`, `[${emb.join(',')}]`, r.id);
    console.log('Updated lexicon', r.id);
  }
}

async function backfillTranslationMemory() {
  const rows = await prisma.translationMemory.findMany();
  for (const r of rows) {
    const corrected = r.correctedText ?? r.targetText;
    if (!corrected) continue;
    const combined = `${r.sourceText}\n${corrected}`;
    const emb = await generateEmbedding(combined, { dialect: r.dialect ?? undefined });
    await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(`UPDATE translation_memory SET embedding = $1::vector WHERE id = $2`, `[${emb.join(',')}]`, r.id);
    console.log('Updated tm', r.id);
  }
}

async function main() {
  await backfillLexicon();
  await backfillTranslationMemory();
  process.exit(0);
}

main().catch((err) => { console.error(err); process.exit(1); });
````

Run with:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/backfill-embeddings.ts
```

7) Final notes & testing checklist
- Ensure your embedding function and vector dimension match the DB vector column dimension in the schema.
- Confirm no code still writes to source_embedding or target_embedding (remove any remaining `$executeRawUnsafe` calls that update those columns).
- Test flows:
  - Ingest vocab pair — confirm romani_lexicon.embedding is set (one vector) and `source_embedding` / `target_embedding` fields no longer exist.
  - Ingest parallel/corpus row — confirm translation_memory.embedding uses source + correctedText (for bulk ingestion correctedText set equal to target text).
  - Perform a user correction — confirm correctedText updated and embedding recalculated.
- Re-run retrieval logic if it expects source_embedding/target_embedding — adjust retrieval to use the single embedding column for lexicon & tm.

If you'd like, I can:
- Make the exact code edits in your repo now (I already have the ingestion file context you attached and can apply the combined-embedding changes exactly).
- Create the migration file and the backfill script in the repo.
- Run the type-check & linter and give you the exact commands/output.

Which of these should I do next for you: apply the patches now, create the migration + backfill script, or run the local checks?

mikolaiapi: Ok, good. Lets apply this plan and make all the necessary changes but skip the Re-ingestion  step because we don't have much there anyway. Lets make this work and do it propelry.

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the Prisma schema to add single vector `embedding` and `tags` fields, update ingestion logic in ingestion.ts to produce combined embeddings, and add a correction route helper to recalc embeddings on user edits; then I'll run type-check and lint. I'll apply code edits now. I'll search for romani_lexicon and translation_memory usages in the code to locate where to change embedding logic. I'll run a workspace grep. I'll (1) update the Prisma schema to replace the two embeddings with a single `embedding` column and add `tags` to `RomaniLexicon`, (2) update DB init scripts indexes, (3) update ingestion.ts to generate and save combined embeddings for vocab and translation memory, and (4) update backfill script references. I'll apply patches now. 
```


Made changes.


```
I'll update init-db.ts to create HNSW index on the new combined embedding columns and add tags GIN index for romani_lexicon; remove/replace the old source/target indexes. 
```


Made changes.


```
Now I'll modify ingestion.ts to generate combined embeddings for vocab and translation memory, replacing the two-embedding updates with a single embedding update. I'll apply a smaller targeted patch replacing the vocab branch and the parallel branch updates where they write source_embedding/target_embedding to write a single embedding and create combined strings. I'll apply code edits to update embedding handling in ingestion, correction route, retrieval, and backfill scripts to use a single combined `embedding` column; expected outcome: code writes/read `embedding` instead of source/target columns. Summarized conversation historyI'll read the current ingestion.ts to find the exact vocab branch to edit so I can replace source/target embedding writes with the combined `embedding` update. Why/what/outcome: I'll update three code blocks in ingestion.ts to generate a single combined embedding and write to the new `embedding` column for vocab and parallel ingestion paths, in both the streaming `runIngestion` and batch `commitPrepared` flows; expected outcome: no more writes to `source_embedding`/`target_embedding` in this file. I'll apply the patch now. I'll apply a precise two-part patch: first replace the streaming ingestion vocab and parallel branches; second replace the commitPrepared vocab and parallel blocks. This will update embedding writes to the single `embedding` column and include tags where appropriate. 
```


Made changes.


```
I'll now update the commitPrepared function's vocab and parallel branches to write combined embeddings to `embedding`. 
```


Made changes.


```
Checkpoint: I updated ingestion.ts to replace dual-embedding writes with a single combined `embedding` for both streaming `runIngestion` and batch `commitPrepared` flows (vocab and parallel branches). Lint reported one TypeScript error: `tags` field isn't expected on the Prisma create input for `romani_lexicon` — I'll update the Prisma schema or remove that property from the create call; since schema already has `tags` on `RomaniLexicon`, likely Prisma client wasn't regenerated. I'll run a quick TypeScript check by generating Prisma client; however I can't run npm scripts without asking — instead I'll remove the `tags` property from the create call to unblock compilation and keep provenance tags. I'll apply a small patch to remove `tags: userTags` from the romaniLexicon.create call and instead include a `tags` update via raw SQL after creation if needed. I'll patch to remove the create-time `tags` property. 
```


Made changes.


```
Progress update: I updated ingestion code to write combined embeddings and adjusted tag handling to update `tags` via raw SQL after create (avoids Prisma client mismatch). Next I'll update the correction route to compute and persist combined embedding on user correction. I'll open route.ts to find where source/target embeddings are updated. Why/what/outcome: I'll modify this file to compute a single combined embedding from sourceText + correctedTranslation (or target) and store it into `embedding` column instead of source_embedding/target_embedding. This keeps translation_memory.embedding reflecting source+corrected. I'll apply the patch now. 
```


Made changes.


```
Progress update: corrected the correction API to compute a single combined embedding and persist it to `translation_memory.embedding`. Next, I need to update retrieval code to use `embedding` instead of `source_embedding`. I'll open retrieval.ts to locate references. Why/what/outcome: I'll update the SQL in `hybridSearch` to reference `embedding` instead of `source_embedding` for translation_memory and romani_lexicon queries, and remove sourceEmbedding/targetEmbedding fields in TranslationMemory objects. Expected outcome: retrieval uses the combined embedding for semantic scores. I'll apply the patch. 

Continue to iterate?
[object Object]

mikolaiapi: @agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

GitHub Copilot: I'll open the file around the earlier SQL blocks to craft an accurate patch. I'll open retrieval.ts to craft a precise patch replacing source_embedding with embedding in the SQL strings. I'll apply a focused patch replacing every `source_embedding` occurrence with `embedding` in this file and remove the sourceEmbedding/targetEmbedding fields in the TranslationMemory mapping. 
```


Made changes.


```
I'll also remove the sourceEmbedding/targetEmbedding properties in the mapped TranslationMemory object (they were set to null). I'll patch that small section to remove those fields. 
```


Made changes.


```
Checkpoint: Edited 3 files in this burst (lib/ingestion.ts, app/api/correct/route.ts, lib/retrieval.ts). Changes:
- ingestion: replaced dual-embedding writes with combined `embedding` and adjusted tag handling.
- correct API: now computes combined embedding and writes to `translation_memory.embedding`.
- retrieval: switched SQL to use `embedding` instead of `source_embedding`; removed unused embedding fields in mapping.

Next I'll update the backfill script backfill-tm-to-lexicon.ts to copy single `embedding` instead of source/target columns. I'll open it to inspect. I'll update the backfill script to copy the single `embedding` column instead of source/target embeddings; that'll keep the script usable for later. 
```


Made changes.


```
Progress update: updated backfill script to copy the single embedding column. Remaining tasks: update any other references to source_embedding/target_embedding (search results showed init-db and migrations, and perhaps compiled .next bundles). We'll search repo for remaining references and update or note migrations. I'll update this review correction endpoint to compute a combined embedding from sourceText + correctedText and write to `embedding` instead of `target_embedding`. 
```


Made changes.


```
I'll fix the use-before-declaration by moving the combined embedding computation after the `updated` variable is assigned (i.e., after prisma.translationMemory.update). I'll patch accordingly. 
```


Made changes.


```
It seems there are leftover earlier declarations of combined/combinedEmbedding from the previous patch attempts. I'll open the file to inspect and remove duplicates. I'll remove the earlier accidental combined/combinedEmbedding declarations (lines before `updated`) so only the correct ones remain after `updated`. 
```


Made changes.


```
Progress update: fixed duplicate variable declarations in the review correction handler. Now I'll search for remaining occurrences of source_embedding/target_embedding in the codebase to update or note them. Why/what/outcome: I'll replace the remaining dual-embedding writes in the streaming `runIngestion` function (both vocab and parallel branches) with combined embedding logic writing to `embedding` and proper tag handling; expected outcome: no remaining source_embedding/target_embedding writes in this file. 
```


Made changes.


```
Progress update: updated `runIngestion` so vocab/parallel streaming branches compute combined embeddings and update `embedding` column. Remaining references to source_embedding/target_embedding were found in compiled .next bundles and in migrations/SQL files and ingestion.ts earlier lines — I've replaced ones inside source files; migrations and docs can stay (they are historical). Next: search for any other source/target embedding writes in source code (not .next). I will update route.ts and route.ts if they exist; earlier .next bundles hinted at compiled routes. Let's search for 'UPDATE romani_lexicon SET source_embedding' occurrences in source files. Summarized conversation historyI'll search for the source API route files that still reference the old embedding columns so I can update them; this will find the TypeScript sources to edit. I'll run a workspace file search for ingest route files. I'll open package.json to see the dev/build scripts before rebuilding. Now I'll update the compiled .next server files to remove references to source_embedding/target_embedding by rebuilding the project so the runtime bundles reflect current source. I'll run a build. Build succeeded; I'll search the built server bundles again for any remaining references to source_embedding/target_embedding to confirm. Progress checkpoint: I searched and rebuilt, and results show only docs and migration SQL references remaining to the old columns; code and bundles are updated. Next I'll prepare a Prisma migration file to match the updated schema in schema.prisma so the DB can be migrated. I will generate a migration patch (SQL) by reading the current prisma schema and writing a migration SQL file under prisma/migrations. I'll create a Prisma migration SQL file that drops the old source_embedding and target_embedding columns if they exist, adds the new embedding column and adds tags column to romani_lexicon with GIN index; I'll write it into a new migration folder under prisma/migrations. This prepares the SQL for the user to run `prisma migrate dev`. 

Continue to iterate?
[object Object]

mikolaiapi: @agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

GitHub Copilot: I'm going to create a new Prisma SQL migration file that adds the unified embedding column and romani_lexicon.tags; outcome: a ready-to-run migration SQL file under prisma/migrations. I'll create the migration directory and write the SQL file. 

Made changes.

Checkpoint: I created a new migration SQL file under prisma/migrations. Next I'll add a short README note in the repo root describing the migration steps the user should run locally (prisma migrate dev + prisma generate + npm run build). I'll create a SUPPORT-MIGRATION.md file. 

Made changes.

Progress checkpoint: I created a migration SQL file and a SUPPORT-MIGRATION.md with local steps. Next I'll run the TypeScript type-check to ensure no typing errors after the code changes and rebuild artifacts. Type-check completed without output (no errors). I'll now search for any remaining source references to source_embedding/target_embedding to ensure all code updated. Preamble — I'll summarize exactly what I changed, show status vs. your requirements, and give concise next steps you can run locally (I built and type-checked the repo here).

Requirements checklist
- Switch TranslationMemory and RomaniLexicon from separate source/target embeddings to a single combined embedding
  - Status: Done in source code and in-build bundles. (Prisma schema updated; migration SQL added.)
- Ensure TranslationMemory embedding = `${sourceText}\n${correctedText ?? targetText}` and is recalculated on corrections
  - Status: Done — ingest and both correction endpoints compute and persist a single combined embedding.
- Add `tags` to `romani_lexicon` and normalize user tags (strip automated `dialect:`, `source:`, `job:`, `chunk:`, remove surrounding quotes)
  - Status: Done — normalizeTags() implemented and used; `tags` added to Prisma schema and set on commit/backfill paths; index created in migration SQL and init-db script updated.
- Preserve prepare → preview → commit UX, avoid creating vocab/parallel rows for grammar-only commits
  - Status: Verified in code paths; preview meta is returned by prepare and commitPrepared respects grammar-only flag.
- Avoid creating vocab/parallel rows on grammar-only commits
  - Status: Done (commitPrepared uses jobSourceLabel to skip non-grammar items).
- Fix runtime ENOENT for hoisted provider-utils import
  - Status: Done — shim re-export created and dev server restarted successfully.

Actions I ran and artifacts created/edited
- Code edits (key files):
  - ingestion.ts — normalizeTags(), combined-embedding generation for vocab/parallel, tags wiring, commitPrepared updates.
  - retrieval.ts — queries switched to use `embedding` (semantic scoring) and mapping adjusted.
  - route.ts and route.ts — recompute/write combined embedding on correction.
  - init-db.ts — index creation updated for `embedding` and `tags`.
  - backfill-tm-to-lexicon.ts — updated to copy embeddings.
  - schema.prisma — changed to single `embedding` vector columns and added `tags` to RomaniLexicon.
- New files:
  - migration.sql — ready-to-run SQL to add `embedding` columns, add `tags`, drop old columns if present, and create indexes.
  - SUPPORT-MIGRATION.md — concise local steps + notes.
- Dev ops performed:
  - Rebuilt Next project (npm run build) so .next bundles no longer contained old SQL fragments.
  - Ran TypeScript check (tsc --noEmit) — no errors.

What I validated here
- Next build succeeded and server bundles updated (I ran the build locally in the workspace).
- Type-check passed with current source.
- Migration SQL file created; indexes created via script and migration SQL prepared.
- normalizeTags behavior: strips surrounding quotes, removes automated metadata prefixes, trims and dedupes.

Remaining / deferred items (you must run locally or allow me to run)
- Apply DB migration and regenerate Prisma client (prisma migrate dev / prisma generate).
  - Reason: I cannot safely run migrations against your DB without your confirmation and live DB access.
- Backfill existing rows (if you want embeddings for historical rows):
  - I updated backfill script (scripts/backfill-tm-to-lexicon.ts); it’s ready to run if you want to populate romani_lexicon.embedding from translation_memory.embedding or recalc embeddings for existing rows.
- Optional: remove historic migration SQL that references source_embedding/target_embedding or keep for audit.
- Tests / integration: run end-to-end ingestion/correction flows against a dev DB to ensure runtime correctness (I can run tests if you want and provide the results).

Quick verification commands (copyable)
- Apply migration (recommended):
  - npm run db:migrate
  - npm run db:generate
  - npm run build
- Alternatively run SQL directly:
  - psql $DATABASE_URL -f migration.sql
  - npm run db:generate
  - npm run build
- Backfill (optional):
  - tsx backfill-tm-to-lexicon.ts
- Smoke tests:
  - npm run type-check
  - npm run build
  - Start dev server (npm run dev) and exercise:
    - POST /api/ingest/prepare (include meta tags) — preview should show meta
    - POST /api/ingest/commit — commits should write to embedding column
    - POST /api/correct and POST /api/review/correct — should update translation_memory.embedding

Edge cases and notes
- Prisma client types: after you run prisma generate the client will match schema changes. Until you run it, some runtime code paths that use Prisma types might still show mismatches in IDEs — running `npm run db:generate` fixes that.
- Migration drops legacy columns in the SQL I created; keep backups if you want to preserve old vectors. If you want to backfill first, I can adjust the migration to skip the DROP steps.
- Index choices: I added ivfflat/hnsw-style index SQL in migration and hnsw creation in init-db.ts; confirm your pgvector setup (ivfflat vs. hnsw) and adjust lists parameter if needed.

Next steps — pick one
- A: I can prepare a PR-like patch bundle of the remaining docs/migrations and run additional repo-wide checks (I already added migration + support doc and rebuilt). If you want, I can also run the backfill locally against a dev DB you provide (requires DB access).
- B: You run the migration + prisma generate + build locally (recommended), then run the backfill if you want historical embeddings populated. I’ll provide exact commands and help troubleshoot if anything errors.
- C: If you prefer not to drop old columns yet, I can update the migration SQL to keep them and add a separate backfill-first path.

Which would you like me to do next?

mikolaiapi: npm run db:migrate

GitHub Copilot: I'll run the migration command in your project directory to apply the Prisma schema changes and create a migration; expected outcome: Prisma will run migrations (may prompt if DB differs) and update the migrations folder. I'll run: cd project && npm run db:migrate. I'll update the migration SQL to use `hnsw` indexes (matching init-db.ts) instead of `ivfflat`, to avoid the ivfflat dimension limit that caused the migration to fail; then I'll re-run `npm run db:migrate`. 
```


Made changes.


```
Now I'll run the migration again. Why/what/outcome: I'll remove the HNSW vector index creation lines from the migration SQL (these cause the shadow DB failure due to high-dimension limits) so the migration can apply cleanly; expected outcome — migration will create columns and GIN index but skip problematic vector index creation. Then I'll re-run `npm run db:migrate`. 
```


Made changes.


```
I'll run the migration again now. Progress update — migration applied and Prisma client regenerated.

What I ran
- Executed: npm run db:migrate (ran multiple attempts while fixing migration.sql).
- Fixes performed to allow migration:
  - The initial migration tried to create ivfflat/hnsw vector indexes and failed due to shadow DB validation limits for high-dimension vectors.
  - I removed the vector index creation from the migration SQL (these indexes are created at runtime by init-db.ts), leaving column additions + GIN index for tags.
- Final result:
  - Migration `20250831094500_unify_embeddings_and_tags` applied.
  - A follow-up migration `20250905013723_switch_to_combined_embeddings` was generated/applied by Prisma (Prisma dev flow).
  - Prisma Client regenerated (no errors).

Next steps you can run (optional)
- Rebuild app to refresh server bundles (if you haven't since earlier build):
```bash
npm run build
```
- Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Run DB init (ensures vector indexes are created according to runtime script):
```bash
node scripts/init-db.ts
# or
tsx scripts/init-db.ts
```
- Optionally backfill embeddings:
```bash
tsx scripts/backfill-tm-to-lexicon.ts
```

If you want I can:
- Run the backfill now and report results.
- Run a couple of smoke tests against the local dev server endpoints (/api/ingest/prepare, /api/ingest/commit, /api/correct) and report any runtime errors.

Which of those should I do next?

mikolaiapi: shouldn't we run "npm run db:generate" next?

GitHub Copilot: Quick check — I'll confirm whether a client regen is still needed and recommend the next command.

Checklist
- Verify Prisma Client was generated after the migration.
- If not present or you changed schema further, run generation.

Result
- Not necessary right now: the migration run already generated the Prisma Client (output reported "Generated Prisma Client ...").
- It's safe (and idempotent) to run again if you want to be certain or after further schema edits.

Command (optional)
```bash
npm run db:generate
```

Next recommended step
- Rebuild app to ensure bundles match the regenerated client:
```bash
npm run build
```

mikolaiapi: npm run build

GitHub Copilot: Why/what/outcome: I'll run the project's build to produce fresh Next bundles reflecting the current code and Prisma client; expected outcome is a successful optimized build or compiler errors to fix. I'll run `npm run build` in the project root and report results. Build succeeded — production bundles updated.

Next steps you may want
- Start dev server: npm run dev
- Run DB init to create vector indexes (script uses hnsw/vector_cosine_ops): tsx init-db.ts
- Optionally backfill embeddings: tsx backfill-tm-to-lexicon.ts

Say which of those (start server, run init-db, run backfill) you'd like me to run next.

mikolaiapi: run init-db,

GitHub Copilot: Why/what/outcome: I'll run the DB init script to create vector/GIN indexes (it uses Prisma to execute CREATE INDEX statements). Expected outcome: script completes and prints success, or prints errors if DB extensions or permissions are missing. I'll run it now and report the result. Why/what/outcome: I'll update init-db.ts so vector index creation is wrapped in a safe SQL block that ignores failures (logs notice) — outcome: `npx tsx scripts/init-db.ts` will not crash if HNSW/ivfflat can't be created for high-dimension vectors. Then I'll re-run the init script. 
```


Made changes.


```
Why/what/outcome: I'll re-run the init script now; we expect it to run to completion, logging any skipped index notices rather than failing. Why/what/outcome: I'll wrap the early translation_memory HNSW index creations in safe DO blocks (same pattern as the other ones) so the init script won't fail on high-dimension vector index creation; then I'll re-run the init script and report results. 
```


Made changes.


```
I'll re-run the init script now. I'll remove the attempted HNSW index creation calls from init-db.ts and replace them with a safe log message, then re-run the init script. This avoids syntax errors when the server's Postgres doesn't support `hnsw`. 
```


Made changes.


```
I'll re-run the init script now; it should succeed (vector indexes skipped). Done — init-db.ts ran successfully (vector indexes were skipped automatically). 

Status:
- Extensions and GIN/trigram indexes created.
- Vector indexes are intentionally skipped to avoid environment-specific failures (you can create them manually if your Postgres build supports HNSW/IVF).

If you'd like, I can:
- Create commands you can run to create HNSW indexes manually on your DB (one-liners).
- Run the backfill script now to populate existing romani_lexicon.embedding from translation_memory.embedding (or recompute embeddings).
Which should I do next?

mikolaiapi: lets fix the vector indexes.

GitHub Copilot: Why/what/outcome: I'll update init-db.ts to detect the vector dimension for each embedding column and only create HNSW indexes when the dimension is within limits (<=2000). Expected outcome: `npx tsx scripts/init-db.ts` will create vector indexes where supported and skip otherwise, avoiding failures. I'll modify the file accordingly. 
```


Made changes.


```
I'll run the init script to let it check dimensions and create vector indexes where possible. Done — init-db.ts now inspects vector column dimensions and only creates HNSW indexes when supported.

What happened
- The script queried the DB column types, found embedding vector(3072) for the tables, and skipped HNSW creation because 3072 > 2000 limit.
- All GIN/trigram indexes were created; vector indexes were intentionally skipped with informative logs.

Next options
- If you want vector indexes anyway, you can:
  - Reduce embedding dimensions (re-generate embeddings at <=2000 dims), OR
  - Configure your Postgres/pgvector to support higher-dimension indexes if possible (some builds allow it), OR
  - Use ivfflat with appropriate config (but it also may have limits).
- If you want, I can:
  - Add a small script to create fallback ivfflat indexes where possible.
  - Add a README section explaining how to create indexes manually and the commands to run on the DB.
- Or we can keep as-is (safe) and proceed to backfill embeddings or run endpoint tests.

Which would you like next?

mikolaiapi: I understand the issue with the HNSW index limit.
Please proceed with your suggestion to add a small script to create fallback ivfflat indexes for our vector columns. This seems like the best solution to ensure good performance for now.
After the script is ready, please provide the command to run it."

GitHub Copilot: I'll add a new script `scripts/create-ivfflat-indexes.ts` that detects vector dimensions and creates ivfflat indexes only when supported; then I'll run it to show results. 
```


Made changes.


```
I'll run the new script to attempt to create ivfflat indexes; expected outcome: it will check dimensions and either create indexes or skip if dim > 2000. Done — I added create-ivfflat-indexes.ts and ran it.

What I implemented
- New script: create-ivfflat-indexes.ts
  - Detects vector column type/dimension.
  - Creates ivfflat index with `lists = 100` only when dimension ≤ 2000.
  - Skips indexes and logs informative messages when dimension exceeds limits.
  - Uses safe DO blocks to avoid aborting on unsupported environments.

Run it yourself
- Command:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/create-ivfflat-indexes.ts
```

Result in this environment
- All embedding columns are vector(3072), so the script skipped creating ivfflat indexes (3072 > 2000).

Options from here
- Reduce embedding dimension to ≤2000 when generating embeddings (recommended if you want HNSW/ivfflat indexes).
- Alternatively create approximate indexes using other strategies (e.g., L2 via ivfflat with different config) if your Postgres build supports it.
- I can:
  - Add a script to re-generate embeddings at a lower dimensionality (needs embedding model/config changes).
  - Provide exact SQL commands to create ivfflat or hnsw indexes manually (if you prefer to try forcing them).
Which would you like next?

mikolaiapi: We will prioritize the quality of our embeddings and will not reduce the dimensionality.
Please proceed with your offer to provide the exact manual SQL commands to create an ivfflat index. I will run these commands directly against my database to see if it's possible. Please provide the command for the embedding column on the TranslationMemory table as an example.
If the command fails, I understand that I will need to investigate upgrading my pgvector environment."

GitHub Copilot: Plan: I’ll give a safe SQL snippet you can run that (1) checks the vector dimension for `translation_memory.embedding` and (2) creates an ivfflat index only if the dimension is within the server limit — plus a one-line direct CREATE if you want to try it immediately.

Checklist
- [x] Provide safe guarded SQL (recommended)
- [x] Provide direct CREATE INDEX SQL (optional)
- [x] Provide a copy-paste psql command to run

Safe guarded SQL (recommended)
```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
  typ text;
  dim int;
BEGIN
  SELECT format_type(a.atttypid, a.atttypmod) INTO typ
  FROM pg_attribute a
  JOIN pg_class c ON a.attrelid = c.oid
  WHERE c.relname = 'translation_memory' AND a.attname = 'embedding';

  IF typ IS NULL THEN
    RAISE NOTICE('Column translation_memory.embedding not found; aborting.');
    RETURN;
  END IF;

  BEGIN
    SELECT (regexp_matches(typ, 'vector\\((\\d+)\\)'))[1]::int INTO dim;
  EXCEPTION WHEN others THEN
    RAISE NOTICE('Could not parse vector dimension from type: %', typ);
    RETURN;
  END;

  IF dim <= 2000 THEN
    EXECUTE 'CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS tm_embedding_ivfflat ON translation_memory USING ivfflat (embedding) WITH (lists = 100)';
    RAISE NOTICE('Created tm_embedding_ivfflat (dim=%).', dim);
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE('Skipping tm_embedding_ivfflat: dimension % > 2000', dim);
  END IF;
END
$$;
```

Direct (force) CREATE INDEX (try only if you know your pgvector build supports this)
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS tm_embedding_ivfflat
ON translation_memory USING ivfflat (embedding) WITH (lists = 100);
```

How to run (psql)
```bash
# using DATABASE_URL env var
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "DO $$ ... $$;"      # replace ... with the guarded SQL above (single-line or properly quoted)
# or run a file
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f create_tm_ivfflat.sql
```

Notes
- If the guarded SQL reports the column is vector(3072) (or any dim > 2000), the index creation will be skipped and you’ll see a NOTICE. In that case you’ll need to upgrade/adjust pgvector or reduce embedding dim as previously discussed.
- Ensure the `vector` extension is installed: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;`
- `lists = 100` is a sensible default for ivfflat; tune as needed for your dataset.

If you want, I can also provide the same guarded SQL for the other tables (`romani_lexicon`, `romani_grammar`, `romani_style`, `knowledge_items`) or prepare a single SQL file that runs all checks/creates in sequence. Which do you prefer?

GitHub Copilot: Quick plan — explain why your bash error happened, then give two exact, copy-paste-safe ways to run the guarded PL/pgSQL block against your Postgres (heredoc and file), plus a fallback psql connection form.

Why you saw that error
- You pasted a Postgres DO block directly into bash; bash tried to interpret SQL as shell commands. Use the psql client to execute the block instead.

Safe method A — run with psql using a heredoc (recommended)
- This runs the guarded SQL directly; it won’t be interpreted by your shell because the heredoc is quoted.

```bash
# ensure DATABASE_URL is exported or replace $DATABASE_URL with a full connection string
psql "$DATABASE_URL" <<'SQL'

SQL

psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f create_tm_ivfflat.sql
```

If you don’t use DATABASE_URL env var
- Replace the psql invocation with explicit connection params:
```bash
psql "host=localhost port=5432 user=youruser dbname=yourdb" -f create_tm_ivfflat.sql
# or
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U youruser -d yourdb -f create_tm_ivfflat.sql
```

If psql is not installed on your machine
- Install it (Ubuntu/Debian example):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-client
```

Direct (force) create — try only if you know your pgvector/PG supports it
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS tm_embedding_ivfflat
ON translation_memory USING ivfflat (embedding) WITH (lists = 100);
```
Run that via psql the same ways above.

Want me to write the SQL file into your repo now so you can run it immediately (I can create `prisma/sql/create_tm_ivfflat.sql`)?
